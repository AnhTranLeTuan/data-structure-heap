# Data Structure: Heap

## Description
Experiment with concepts of heap. There will be two type of heap: max heap, which the parent node must be greater than or equal to either of its child nodes, and min heap, which the parent node must be smaller than or equal to either of its child nodes. In this project, we can see how:
* Although the heap is a binary tree, we actually will use the array to implement it instead of the linked list, which is very interesting

NOTE: The position of elements in the heap will depend on it is max heap or min heap
* Insert an element into the heap (bubble up will be required to follow the heap's rules)
* Remove and return the first or the top-most element from the heap (bubble down will be required to follow the heap's rules)
* Solve problems by using heap
  * Implement the priority queue with heap
  * Sort a collection of items in the ascending order
  * Sort a collection of items in the descending order
  * Heapify which means converting the array into a heap in place (note that we can barely mimic the heap with the array, and depending on the order of the array, the algorithm will not work)
  * Kth largest item of a collection of values
